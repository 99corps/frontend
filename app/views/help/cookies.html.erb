    <h1>Cookies</h1>
    
    <p>When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. This sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your computer. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally on this site.</p>

    <p>These pieces of information can be used to improve the service we provide to you by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>remembering settings so you don't have to select them whenever you load a page</li>
      <li>remembering information you've given (e.g. your postcode) so you don't need to enter it several times</li>
      <li>measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets your needs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them from <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" title="Information about Cookies">AboutCookies.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
    
    <p>GOV.UK uses cookies in several places - we've listed each of them below with more details about why we use them and how long they will last.</p>
    
    <p>In most cases, we will let you know <strong>before</strong> we store a cookie on your computer by providing an icon similar to this: <span class="sets-cookie" style="background: #fde387; font-size: 0.8em; border: #bc9509; padding: 2px 3px; border-radius: 0.5em;"><a href="#" title="This link is an example that doesn't do anything">sets a cookie</a>.</span></p>

    <p>Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. This information cannot be used to identify you and we do not allow Google to use our analytics data.</p>

    <h3 id="tourcookies">Remembering if you've seen the GOV.UK introductory popup box</h3>
    <p>On your first visit to the GOV.UK beta website, you will see a popup box welcoming you to the website and providing background to the beta. When you close this box, we will store a cookie so that we know you have seen the popup and know not to show it to you again.</p>
    
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>

    <h3 id="locationcookies">Storing your approximate location</h3>
    <p>Some parts of this website provides you with information related to your location.  For example, rather than providing a list of all <a href="/uk-online-centre-internet-access-computer-training" title="find UK Online Centres near you">UK Online Centres</a>, we just can usually direct you to the nearest one.</p>
    
    <p>When you enter your postcode we save it (and related information such as your longitude, latitude and a friendly name for the location) to a cookie.  Saving the information to a cookie means that you don't need to type in the postcode every time.</p>
    
    <table>
      <thead>

          <th>Name</th>

    <h3 id="usabilitycookies">Storing your usability settings</h3>
    <p>The GOV.UK website provides usability settings that can be switched on as required.  When these settings are turned on, we store this in a cookie so that we know to use these settings on every page you look at.</p>
    
    <table>

        <tr>

    <h3 id="feedbackcookies">Remembering your feedback settings</h3>
    <p>Most pages on the GOV.UK show a floating box that asks you to let us know if the content was helpful or not.  When you close this box (by either providing feedback or clicking the close button), we store a cookie so that we know not to show the box again.</p>
