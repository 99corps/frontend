    <h1>Cookies</h1>
    
    <p>When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. This sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your computer. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally on this site.</p>

    <p>These pieces of information can be used to improve the service we provide to you by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>remembering settings so you don't have to select them whenever you load a page</li>
      <li>remembering information you've given (e.g. your postcode) so you don't need to enter it several times</li>
      <li>measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets your needs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them from <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" title="Information about Cookies">AboutCookies.org</a>.</p>
