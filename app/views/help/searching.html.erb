    <h1>How to find what you are looking for</h1>
    <p>You can navigate this site in three main ways:</p>

    <h2>1. Search</h2>

    <p>The search box is found on the top right of every page. As you enter your search term, suggested links will appear below so you can quickly find the pages you are looking for. If you complete your search term and click 'go', you will be taken to a results page displaying the relevant content. Different types of content – such as text, multimedia or tools – have symbols to distinguish them so that you can easily choose the right one for you.</p>

    <h2>2. ‘Related’ links</h2>

    <p>You’ll find the ‘Related’ [or ‘Other useful pages’] box on the right hand side of every page. It displays links to other pages and tools that should be relevant to you, based on whatever you’re reading at the time.</p>

    <h2>3. Top-level navigation bar</h2>

    <p>At the top of each page, you’ll see a navigation bar that shows you which section of the site you’re currently in (it’s the one underneath the GOV.UK masthead that currently says ‘Home > Help’). Use it to return to the main section or website homepage.</p>
