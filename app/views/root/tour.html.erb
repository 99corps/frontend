     <h2>Start with search</h2>
     <p>People begin most internet journeys with search. So that's where our site begins.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!--[point to main search box] -->

     <h2>Simple navigation</h2>
     <p>We keep the options simple and clear, and always show you where you are on the site.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!-- [point to top nav and the crumb trail (is that what you call it?)] -->
     
     <h2>Clearly grouped content</h2>
     <p>A clear pop-up menu takes you straight to the most popular and useful pages and topics.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!-- [point to main pop-up nav at bottom of page] -->

     <h2>Space to breathe</h2>
     <p>The clean design takes the eye straight to the most important content, making the site fast and easy to navigate.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!-- [point to main promo area in the middle of the homepage i.e. the nice big photos] -->
     
     <h2>Clearly organised information</h2>
     <p>If you don't find what you need straight away a 'related' menu shows you other things we think might be useful.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!-- [show example of clear, simple page] -->

     <h2>Each page makes sense</h2>
     <p>If people arrive at our pages from an external search, each page needs to make standalone sense.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!-- [show a typical (and clear) landing page] -->  
     
     
     <h2>Information is presented in a few different ways:</h2>
     <p>Guides are groups of information that are more lengthy or complex. Most guides have chapters on the left-hand side, allowing you to quickly access the right information.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!-- [Screenshot of Find out about adult learning and skills guide] -->  


     <p>Quick answers provide concise answers to popular user questions. Less text, more specific answers.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!-- [Screenshot of Child Benefit rates quick answer] -->  

     <p>Or if it's more complicated, you can answer a series of questions and we'll give you the information you need.</p>
     <%= image_tag 'tour/example.png' %>  <!-- [Screenshot of Maternity benefits you're eligible for smart answer] -->
