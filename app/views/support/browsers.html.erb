        <h2 id="what-is-a-browser">What is a browser?</h2>
        <p>A browser is a piece of software on your computer that allows you to access and look at the internet.</p>
        <p>You can find out which browser you're using by clicking "Help" or "About" from the file menu of the window you're in right now.</p>

        <h2 id="why-should-i-upgrade">Why should I upgrade?</h2>
        <p>When you're online looking at websites, your browser is the piece of software that lets you do this.  It also is the pieces of software that keeps you safe.  If your browser is out of date, you may be more open to insecurities and malware.</p>
        <p>Upgrading to a modern browser also comes with additional features, often including a faster browsing experience with more features available to you on the websites you use most often, and many will let you know if a site you're using is insecure or otherwise unsafe.</p>

        <h2 id="how-do-i-upgrade-my-browser">How do I upgrade my browser?</h2>
        <p>Upgrading is as simple as downloading a newer browser and installing it on your computer.  Here's a list of options that will keep themselves up to date, each with a website that'll explain it's features and how to install it - you should pick one that works for your operating system (i.e. Microsoft Windows or Apple OS) and that has the features you like best.  If you're not sure, pick any one and try it out for a while - you can always change to a different browser later, and they're all free.</p>
        <h3>For any OS (Windows, Apple OS):</h3>

        </ul>

        <h2 id="im-on-a-shared-computer">I'm on a shared or public computer - how do I upgrade?</h2>
        <p>If you are on a shared computer at home, speak to whoever maintains the computer about upgrading to a better browser, or if that's you - let everyone who uses the computer know that you've installed a new piece of software for them to use.</p>
        <p>If you're on a public machine, such as at a library, speak to a member of staff to request that they upgrade their software.</p>
