        <h2 id="what-is-a-browser">What is a browser?</h2>
        <p>A browser is a piece of software on your computer that allows you to access and look at the internet.</p>
        <p>You can find out which browser you're using by clicking "Help" or "About" from the file menu of the window you're in right now.</p>

        <h2 id="why-should-i-upgrade">Why should I upgrade?</h2>
        <p>When you're online looking at websites, your browser is the piece of software that lets you do this.  It also is the pieces of software that keeps you safe.  If your browser is out of date, you may be more open to insecurities and malware.</p>
        <p>Upgrading to a modern browser also comes with additional features, often including a faster browsing experience with more features available to you on the websites you use most often.</p>

        <h2 id="how-do-i-upgrade-my-browser">How do I upgrade my browser?</h2>
        <p>Upgrading is as simple as downloading a newer browser and installing it on your computer.  Here's a list of options that will keep themselves up to date, each with a website that'll explain it's features and how to install it - you should pick one that works for your operating system (i.e. Microsoft Windows or Apple OS) and that has the features you like best.  If you're not sure, pick any one and try it out for a while - you can always change to a different browser later.</p>
        <h3>For any OS (Windows, Apple OS):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
