This could be for example if:\r\n\r\n* the child usually lives with you\r\n* the child keeps their toys, clothes and so on at your home\r\n* you pay for their meals and give them pocket money\r\n\r\nThere can be exceptions to this, for example, if a child from abroad lives with you as an exchange student. You can\u2019t claim Child Tax Credit for them, because they do not usually live with you and are only in the UK for their education.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure whether you count as being responsible for a child you can call the Tax Credit Helpline for advice.\r\n\r\n[Contact the Tax Credit Helpline](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Directories/DG_10011368 \"Contact the Tax Credit Helpline\")\r\n\r\n##Adoptive parents and foster parents\r\nA child might be placed with you for either adoption or fostering.

You can't both get Child Tax Credit for the same child, so you'll have to decide who should get it.\r\n\r\nYou can't claim Child Tax Credit if your child doesn't live with you at all - even if you're paying maintenance.\r\n\r\n###If you can\u2019t agree who\u2019ll claim\r\nIf you can't agree who'll get the Child Tax Credit, both of you should claim for the child. Then the Tax Credit Office will decide for you. They'll contact both of you so that they can work out who has main responsibility for the child. They will consider things that include the number of days the child lives with you, and where they keep most of their clothes and toys.\r\n\r\n###If you're already getting tax credits for your child\r\nSomeone else might make a claim for a child you're getting Child Tax Credit for. If this happens, the Tax Credit Office may ask you to tell them why you think you have main responsibility for that child.\r\n\r\nIf you can't agree who should get the Child Tax Credit, the Tax Credit Office will decide for you. You'll still keep getting paid while they make their decision.","slug":"further-information","title":"Further information"}],"type":"programme"}
