You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything.\"\n\"But the plans were on display ...\"\n\"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.\"\n\"That's the display department.\"\n\"With a flashlight.\"\n\"Ah, well the lights had probably gone.\"\n\"So had the stairs.\"\n\"But look, you found the notice didn't you?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Arthur, \"yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard'.\"\n"
